Methods that do not appear to function correctly:

removeBack()
removeFront()
isEmpty()

My speculation is that there is an error in the way that isEmpty() is implemented.
It appears to be throwing true on all inputs. I would guess that both removeBack()
and removeFront() are implemented correctly, but rely on the (broken) isEmpty() to
decide whether or not to remove elements from the list. Because isEmpty() always 
returns true, the removal methods will refuse to remove elements as they are 
incorrectly guarding against the list being empty.
